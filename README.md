# ColorChangePage
A simple React app that changes the color of a webpage using buttons. This project is just a way to practice using context and hooks in React.

# Docker/Dockerhub
In addition to learning how to use context and hooks in React, I have used this project to learn how to build this code in docker and upload it
to DockerHub. This has been done using Github Actions.
